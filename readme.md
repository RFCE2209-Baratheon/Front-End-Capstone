#### Hosting

> Configuring the server

After you have built the project you may host locally or externally on a third-party hosting service.

The server, by default, is hosted locally on port 3000. Be sure that this port is available or configure it in the server/index.js file.

Additionally you will need to provide a github access token in order to request data from the API. This is stored in a config.js file in the main directory. The format to the config.js file should look something like the one below.

module.exports = { TOKEN: 'MyGitHubAPItoken' }

To run this locally simply run the follow command

```
npm run server-dev
```
